<h1 align="center">Forum UI</h1>

**Forum UI** contains a collection of components that Forum Ventures has used to develop a series of our Studio applications. These help us ship new features faster.

Many of these features are 'batteries included' and rely on some of the following popular and battle-tested libraries:

- [React-Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
